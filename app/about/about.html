    <h1>Word Multi Search</h1>
    <p>This application helps language learners by opening several different searches simulataneously for a search term such as a foreign word or phrase.</p>
    <p>It was written by <a href="http://peterjc.com">Peter Carroll</a>, who is also one of the guys behind <a href="https://rhinospike.com">RhinoSpike</a>. It is open source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/peterjcarroll/wordmultisearch">GitHub</a>. This project was inspired by <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/">Gabe Wyner</a> and the <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/multi-search/">search macros he created</a> to help make flashcard creation faster.</p>
